            <p>This Easy Pesto Chicken and Vegetables meal prep is super fast and easy, and holds up well in the fridge for tasty lunches all week!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 zucchini</li>
                <li>3 yellow squash</li>
                <li>1 red onion</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil
                    <ul>
                        <li>olive oil preferred, but can substitute avacado oil</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>1.5 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>2 cups frozen greenbeans</li>
                <li>2 cups pesto</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/8 black pepper</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp grated parmesan</li>           
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the yellow squash, zucchini, and slice the red onion. I like to make different shapes for each vegetable, but aim to make the pieces all around the same size.</li>
            <li>Cube the chicken breasts into ½-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high. Once the skillet and oil are very hot, add the chicken and sauté until the chicken pieces are opaque (3-5 minutes, the chicken will continue to cook as you add vegetables).</li>
            <li>Add the green beans to the skillet and sauté for 1-2 minutes more, or just until thawed.</li>
            <li>Add the red onion to the skillet. Sauté for 1-2 minutes more. If water is beginning to pool in the skillet, turn the heat up slightly. It should be hot enough that the water released from the vegetables evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>Add the yellow squash and zucchini to the skillet and continue to sauté 2-3 minutes more, or just until the squash softens slightly.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat off, add the pesto to the skillet, and stir until everything is coated. Give the vegetables a taste and add salt, pepper, or more pesto if desired. Top with a light sprinkle of Parmesan just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>You may need more or less pesto, salt, pepper, or parmesan cheese depending on the volume of your veggies and personal taste</p>
