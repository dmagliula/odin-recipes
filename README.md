This is my first major project using HTML.
Nervous but excited to get myself started!
I am looking forward to using all of the htmp lessons from the Odin Project. My skills are mainly going to be creating a basic website at first and getting it to a place where all of the information can live.
I really want to work on my skills using Git and Github. Being able to commit, make commit messages correctly, and using the command line to make sure I understand how to do this correctly. I also an looking forward to pushing my project on to GitHub and start a basic portfolio.
